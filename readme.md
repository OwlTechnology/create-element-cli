# Custom Element CLI

This is a simple CLI tool that can quickly create Javascript templates for 
v1-spec custom elements.

## Installation

To install, simply run:

```CLI
npm i -g create-element-cli
```

## Creating an Element

To create an element, run the following:

```CLI
create-element [element-name]
```

This will create `[element-name].js` in the folder where the command was run, 
where `[element-name]` is the name of the literal element that you want to
create.
